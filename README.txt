Aliens.java is the main method and contains the interface part of the assignment.
Aliens_GLEventListener.java is the event listener class where the scene and its elements are rendered.

All the textures used in the scene are contained in the folder textures

TwoTriangles.java and TwoTriangles2.java are used to create the backdrop and the floor of the scene.

Fragment shaders and vertex shaders used are in shaders folder.

I'm using Camera, Light, Material, Mesh, Model, NameNode , SGNode, Shader, Sphere, TextureLibrary, TransformNode classes 
from the tutorial.

You can run the program from Aliens.java code.
